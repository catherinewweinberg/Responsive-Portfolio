# Responsive-Portfolio

My portfolio is currently a work in progress. The "Connect With Me" section is not floating to the right like how I had anticipated. I believe there is conflicting data in the style.css document that is preventing this from floating.

There are several projects that I have linked within the portfolio section that need a few adjustments. Here are the items that I am currently working on:

Crystal Collector: The wins and losses are not calculating correctly.

Fraggle Rock Trivia: The game is not telling the player which questions they got correct and the finish button is not working.

Train Scheduler: My moment.js calculation is off.
